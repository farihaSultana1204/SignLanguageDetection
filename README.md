# SignLanguageDetection
<br>
This Python script is for a sign language detection application using computer vision techniques. It utilizes the OpenCV library for video capture and image processing, along with additional modules like HandTrackingModule and ClassificationModule from the cvzone library. The script is structured with a GUI built using Tkinter, providing two frames: a welcome frame and a detection frame. The welcome frame displays a series of messages and a button to start the detection process. Upon pressing the button, the script switches to the detection frame, where live video from the webcam is displayed. It continuously detects hand gestures using the hand tracking module, crops and preprocesses the hand region, and then uses a pre-trained classifier model to classify the hand gestures, displaying the detected sign label on the GUI. The script integrates image processing, machine learning, and GUI programming to create an interactive sign language detection application.
